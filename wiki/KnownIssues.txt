### Known Issues

* Configuring:  Some systems need an additional library (or something)
for stack fortification.  mkconfig does not locate this.
* MacOS: The libtommath library available via MacPorts currently has
issues (see: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/71791 )
* DragonFly BSD: If quotas are not turned on in the kernel
(/boot/loader.conf), the vquotctl interface will not be configured
into _di_.
* Quotas:
    * Solaris ufs requires the quotas file to be readable or make the
_di_ program setuid.  Neither is recommended.
    * Linux 2.4: not working
    * HP-UX: quotactl isn't declared (some versions of HP-UX).
Quota support may need to be turned on manually.
    * NetBSD 6: group quotas can't be fetched by ordinary users (EPERM).
If the account is limited by a group quota, it will not be reported.
    * AIX 7: Unlike AIX 5, AIX 7 gives a permission denied error when
the user tries to get their quota.  Could make _di_ suid, but that's
not a good idea.
* Pooled Filesystems
    * HAMMER2: The usage reported for pseudo-filesystems is the usage
for the main pool.  Therefore the total used and total size will be
wrong.
    * BTRFS: There is no way to identify the pools.
